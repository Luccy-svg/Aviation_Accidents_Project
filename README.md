# Phase 1 Project README.md
## Overview
- Data used was 'AviationData.csv'. The data has an encoding of 'windows-1252', with low_memory=false so as to prevent dtype misinfernce.
- The Event.Date was converted to datetime with error handling.
- The injury columns (Total.Fatal.Injuries, Total.Serious.Injuries, Total.Minor.Injuries) Was converted to numerical values.
- Total injuries computation was done by adding fatal,serious and minor injuries to give total_injuries.
- Created a combined Aircraft identifier, shown by (df['Aircraft'] = df['Make'].astype(str) + " " + df['Model'].astype(str)).
- Extracted accident Year from the Event.Date into a Years column.
- Computed top 10 countries with the highest total_injuries and displayed a horizintal bar chart, also , grouped Injuries by Make and Model.
- Identified the top 5 Aircraft makes with the highest total injuries and displayed injuries per time using bar charts or histograms.
- The trend was analyzed by filtering records from 1990 onwards and analyzed injuries per year per aicraft make to reveal safety improvements and risk patterns.
## Business Understanding
### StakeHolders
From the analysis done the stake holders are identified and their roles or intersts are shown as follows:
- Aviation Safety Authorities - Understand risk patterns and enforce safety regulations.
- Aircraft Manufucturers - Analyze if certain models or engine types are more accident prone.
- Insurance Companies - Assess risk and set premiums based on the accident trends.
- Policy Makers - Inform safety guidelines, weather protcals or aircraft use regulations.
- Investigative Boards - Supprt root cause analysis with data trends.
- Pilots and Unions - Advcate for safer practices and better equipment.
- General Public - Transparency about risks and safety improvements.
### Key Business Questions
- The questions the analysis helps to answer are:
- Which aircrafts Make and Model are involved in the highest number of injury-related accidents?
- How do the weather conditions influence the number of accidents?
- Has the number of injuries increased or decreased over the years?
- Are there certain phases of flights where accidents are more severe?
- Are specific engine types associated with more injuries?
- Are there clusters of accidents that show a recurring pattern?
- Which country has the most injured related accidents?
## Data Understanding and analysis
The main data set used is AviationData.csv. It is sourced from Kaggle.
-The format used is CSV, encoded in 'windows-1252'
- The structure of the data is represented by an accident or incident involving and Aircraft.
- Key columns used in the analysis are Event.Date, Make,Model, Country, Total.Fatal.Injuries,Total.Seriuos.Injuries, Total.Minor.Injuries, Broad.phase.of.flight, Weather.Condition, Engine.Type.
- There is missing values Weather.Condition, Engine.Type and category like Broad.Phase.of.flight are sometimes vague or incosistent.
### Data Cleaning Performed
- Converted date fields using pd.to_datetime.
- Converted injury columns to numeric using pd.to_numeric.
- Filtered data by year for trend analysis(1990-2022).
- Created a derived column total_injuries = fatal + serious + minor.
- Merged or created derived identifiers(Aircraft = Make + Model).
### Data Analysis
Data was explored and patterns were created:
#### Injury Analysis
The analysis was done by Country, Aircraft Make/Model, Flight phase, Weather condition and Engine type.

![Most Used Aircraft](images/Most_Used_Aircraft.png)
![Countires by total injuries](images/Countires_by_total_injuries)
#### Trend Analysis
The analysis was done by Yearly injuries(1990-2022), Top 5 Aircraft makes over time(injury trends acrss year).

## Summary
- Aircraft models with high fatal injury ratios may indicate design r an peratinal vulnerability.
- Aircrafts with high fatal ratio compared to low serious injury ratio indicate that accidents are likely to be deadly rather than survivable.
- Repeated risky models from same manufacturer indicates a pattern of safety issues maybe from engineering r maintenance guidelines.
- If aircrafts show low serious injuries and not fatal, could indicate that the aircraft could be suitable for certain routes and operations.
- Certain countries and aircraft Makes show higher injury rates.
- Most injuries occur during Cruise or Takeoff.
- Weather and engine type significantly affect accident severity.
- The analysis of aviation Accident Data reveals important patterns related to aircraft safety overtime, using variables susch as country, aircraft type,engine type, weather conditions and injury severity.
### Relevant findings:
#### Most Risky Aircraft Makes:
A small number of aircraft manufacturers, notably the top 5 makes(747-168 Boeing, TU-154 Tupolev, 172N Cessna, 152 Cessna, PA-28-181 Piper), accounted for a large share of total injuries. This suggests that specific aircraft types may require closer scrutiny or improved maintenance protocols. 
#### Flight phase matter:
Most injuries occurred during Cruise, Takeoff, Maneuvering and Approach, indicating that these critical moments in flight are the most vulnerable to accidents â€” aligning with known aviation risk patterns.
#### Engine Type matters:
Most injuries occurred when using the Reciprocating Engine Type, indicating that this type of engine is bad or faulty and the Aircraft manufucturers should have them recalled or looked into.
### Final Insight:
After filtering data from 1990- 2022, a slight decline in injury trends is observed for most top aircraft makes thus highlighting the impact of improved technology, training, and regulations over the last three decades.
